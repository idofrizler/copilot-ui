## Features

### Chat & Sessions

- 💰 **Cost indicators** - See relative pricing for each model
- 💾 **Persistent settings** - Your model preference is saved per session

### Working Directory & Trust
- 📁 **Per-session working directory** - Each session can operate in a different folder
- 🔒 **Directory trust flow** - Prompted to trust folders before granting access (once/always/deny)
- 🔄 **Directory picker** - Change working directory via the session info panel

### Permissions & Security
- ✅ **Command approval** - Review and approve shell commands before execution
- 📋 **Per-executable tracking** - "Always allow" works per command (mkdir, ls, etc.)
- 📄 **File change approval** - Approve file writes with path visibility
- 🚫 **Out-of-scope protection** - Extra confirmation for reading files outside workspace

- 📜 **Previous sessions** - Access and restore past conversations
- 🎯 **Auto-focus input** - Chat input is focused when switching sessions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note:** pnpm may have memory issues with some Node.js versions. Use npm if you encounter problems.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## How It Works

This app uses the official [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@github/copilot-sdk) to communicate directly with GitHub Copilot. It creates a native Electron window with a React-based chat interface.

The SDK uses your existing GitHub authentication (via `gh` CLI) to authenticate requests.

### Architecture

- **Multiple CopilotClients** - One client per unique working directory for proper cwd isolation
- **Session state** - Tracks model, cwd, and always-allowed executables per session
- **IPC bridge** - Secure communication between main process and renderer

## Tech Stack

- **Electron** - Native desktop app
- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Copilot SDK** - GitHub Copilot integration
- **electron-store** - Settings and session persistence
- **react-markdown** - Response formatting
